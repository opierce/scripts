# Scripts
A collection of scripts I've made or modified. I'm always looking to add to this!

## Watermark
I wanted a tool to create watermarks on my photos. I found a cool approach online and modified it to suit my needs. It was written on a Mac, and has _some_ domain specific language. Next steps for this would include making it search for fonts in a platform-appropriate way and giving it a batch option to get all files in a directory.
